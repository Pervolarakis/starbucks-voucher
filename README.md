## Introduction

This project was part of my university's UI design course and focuses on creating a Starbucks-themed website with a free voucher promotion feature. The website allows users to apply for free vouchers, and once the promotion period ends, an admin can automatically select and draft the winners. The lucky winners will receive a unique voucher number that they can redeem on the website.

The primary technologies used for this project are Adobe XD for the initial design and React.js with Bootstrap for the implementation.
